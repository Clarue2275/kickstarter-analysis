Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
    Analyze data to show campaign results in relation to their launch dates and funding goals. 
### Purpose
	To determine which campaigns worked best in relation to the metrics used.
## Analysis and Challenges
	a. Anaylze outcomes based on the launch dates of campaigns to determine which time frame produces the best results.
	b. Analyze outcomes based on funding goals of campaigns to determine which campaigns were successful.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
	It can be determined from te data that more successful campaigns were during the months between May-Aug while less successful campaigns were during months between Nov - Jan.
	The rate of failed or canceled campaigns is fairly consistent during all months. However more campaigns were produced during the months from May- Aug, which would contribute to 
	a higher result for each of these months. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
	The Goals set lower than 5000  show the highest success rate, while the greater the goal the lower the rate of success for plays. 
### Challenge
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
	Warmer months produce successful campaigns and colder months produce more failures.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
	Goals for plays set at a lower rate are more likely to be successful.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
	a Table could be added to show the seasons or which quarter the campaigns were produced

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
	There could be a table to display outcomes of the success of the category type
	A table to display outcomes of the success of the subcategory type
	A graph to display  the percentage of the amount pledged in realtion to the goal amount
